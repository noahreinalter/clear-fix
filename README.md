# Clear Fix

## What does it do?
- Stops every clear command from a player from executing for the first time the command is used in a 10s window
- The serve console and commandblocks can still execute the command without confirmation

## Why?
- Especially in the short form without the username it looks like a command to clear the chatlog
- I deleted my inventory unintentionally once, and I'm not doing it again
